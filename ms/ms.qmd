# Introduction

Publishing preprints -- papers communicating non-peer-reviewed research findings -- is now an entrenched practice across a multitude of scientific disciplines [@Ginsparg2011]. While preprint use in biology has had a slower uptake [@Berg2016], in ecology and evolution, new discipline specific preprint servers, such as *EcoEvoRxiv*, provide a means by which ecologists and evolutionary biologists can disseminate research findings. Such practices are expected to promote open science and facilitate the rapid sharing of new discoveries that can have significant impacts on fundamental and applied knowledge globally. 

Preprints attempt to break down barriers to scientific publishing by: 1) increasing the speed, visibility and output of research findings; 2) encouraging constructive and critical feedback from a research community; 3) helping establish precedence of research findings; and 4) removing financial barriers to publication [e.g., @Proulx2013]. *EcoEvoRxiv* is a community driven preprint server that has paved the way for new initiatives, including accepting multilingual preprints, recognising and accepting registered reports and non-traditional research reports, and promoting peer review and community discussion to improve the quality of preprints and speed up their peer-reviewed publication (e.g., Peer Community In -- PCI). 

Preprint servers, such as *EcoEvoRxiv*, can empower researchers to make their findings more accessible, open and transparent but only if they are used well and initiatives are widely known. Significant barriers to preprint use still exist globally â€“ from lack of clarity around preprint policies at journals [@Klebel2020] to a stigma that preprints are viewed by a research community to be of poor quality [@Chiarelli2019] (but see [@Faser2022]). Nonetheless, we lack a systematic understanding of the factors that influence preprint use in ecology and evolution which can help inform future initiatives and allow us to begin to break down barriers to their use in our field. 

Here, we explore the first preprints uploaded to *EcoEvoRxiv*, one of the few community run preprint servers, to understand preprint practices and use in our field, focusing our attention on understanding: 1) how long it takes for a preprint to become published, and how many preprints remain unpublished; 2) what countries make use of preprints; 3) how career stage and gender impact preprint use; 4) whether data and code are more likely to be shared in preprints; and 5) the extent to which authors make use of preprint servers for registered reports and community driven peer review. In the process, we also provide a summary of what makes *EcoEvoRxiv* distinct from other servers which we think will help further educate researchers about the benefits of using community driven preprint servers to post their research findings.

To better understand preprint (and postprint) use on *EcoEvoRxiv*, we downloaded metadata on the articles available on *EcoEvoRxiv* as of `r gsub("UTC", "", dates[2])`.  *EcoEvoRxiv* accepts both preprints and postprints. Postprints are articles that are already published but are the final version of the published paper before typesetting for the research journal. Postprints are a useful way to ensure published articles are openly accessible and can be posted anytime after publication (assuming the journal has a preprint policy that recognised preprints - though most do). For the purpose of summarising articles on *EcoEvoRxiv* we include both preprints and postprints in our 'demographics' analysis. 

### *Demographics of **EcoEvoRxiv** preprints (and postprints)*

After removing `r dim(dupl)[1]` duplicate titles â€“ suggesting a few authors created multiple submissons for the same preprint rather than updating an existing submission â€“ we had data for a total of `r pr` articles with ~55-60 preprints published each month in the last two years (@fig-summary A). Articles covered all major taxomic groups, with the most common being plants (`r sum_taxa$perc[1]`%), vertebrates (`r sum_taxa$perc[6]`%), and invertebrates (`r sum_taxa$perc[5]`%) (@fig-summary B). A total of `r length(unique(countries$country))-1` countries have used *EcoEvoRxiv* as a preprint server. Unsurprisingly, countries in North America and Europe preprint more exstensively. Countries in Africa, Central America and parts of Asia are still slow to use *EcoEvoRxiv* (@fig-summary C). Overall, 90% of the articles come from just `r nrow(most_use)-1` countries. 

### *Diversifying articles types on **EcoEvoRxiv**: overcoming the 'grey literature' problem*

Given that *EcoEvoRxiv* is a community driven preprint server it has managed to diversify the types of articles accepted. It accepts reports and books that are often not easily accessible, but may contain important data of relevance to research syntheses. Accepting a greater diversity of article types allows *EcoEvoRxiv* to begin dealing with the 'grey literature' problem. As a result, articles on *EcoEvoRxiv* are more diverse in nature than other preprint servers; nonetheless, typical research articles (`r sum_types[sum_types$type == "research article",]$perc`%)are still the most common type of preprint, followed by reviews and meta-analyses (`r sum_types[sum_types$type == "reviews and meta-analyses",]$perc`%) and opinion papers (`r sum_types[sum_types$type == "opinion",]$perc`%) (@fig-summary). 

Reports, parcticularly from government and industry research areas exist but are not yet common on *EcoEvoRxiv*. We would encourage authors to consider posting these types of articles to ensure they are openly accessible and more easily found. *EcoEvoRxiv* has already formed fruitful partnerships with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to be a place where their reports can be lodged to make them more easily accessible to the broader research community. For example, IUCN Red Ecosystem Reports are now posted to *EcoEvoRxiv* and our community has been able to work closely with the IUCN to ensure these reports meet the IUCN requirements.

### *Breaking down language barriers to scientific communication: improving diversity and data representation globally*

*EcoEvoRxiv* is the only preprint server that has worked hard to break down language barriers to scientific communication; currently accepting English, Spanish, Portuguese and French manuscripts. Such initiatives are incredible important if we are to Multilingual initiatives have been slow to take off on *EcoEvoRxiv*, with only a few Spanish preprints posted to date, and none in our other accepted langauges (e.g., French and Portuguese). Part of the challenge in getting authors to submit multilingual preprints is the lack of awareness of *EcoEvoRxiv* in non-English speaking countries; cultural differences in the perception of preprints and a strong reliance on traditional publishing models, which typically favour publishing in English.

### *Generational and gender-based gaps in preprinting practices* 

We were interested in getting an understanding of whether career stage is related to preprint use. We used the first publication year of the submitting author as a proxy for career stage. We predicted that early career researchers would be more open to using preprints in Ecology and Evolution. Interestingly, there was strong evidence that the number of preprints posted decreases with later career stages (negative binomial glm: year slope = `r res[2, "Estimate"]`, SE: `r res[2, "Std. Error"]`, *p* < 0.001, N = `r nrow(count_dat[complete.cases(count_dat),])`). The majority of preprints were submitted by authors who published their first paper in the last 10 years ([@fig-summary]E), with the median year of first publication of submitting authors being `r median(data2$submitting_author_first_publication_year, na.rm = TRUE)` (mean = `r round(mean(data2$submitting_author_first_publication_year, na.rm = TRUE),0)`; SD = `r sd(data2$submitting_author_first_publication_year, na.rm = TRUE)`).

Gender differences in preprint use have been established in a number of other research fields. It is hypothsised that such differences are driven by the larger childcare burden of female researchers, which limit their abilities to publish as frequently as their male counterparts [@ucar2022mind; @wehner2020comparison]. Understanding gender publishing patterns is challenging with observational data. We cannot know the gender of authors for certainty but we can use a data driven approach to ascertain the probability that a particular name is of a given gender (male or female). We used the R package *DemografixeR* (vers. `r utils::packageVersion("DemografixeR")`; @RJ-2016-002) to predict the most likely gender of the submitting author of a preprint. We incorperated information about the submitting authors country of affiliation to better account for differences across countries in naming. We only used names where the gender was identified with 95% certainty. 

Overall, females were less likely to publish preprints on *EcoEvoRxiv* compared to males (females: `r (table(data4$gender)[1] / sum(table(data4$gender))*100)`% compared to males: `r (table(data4$gender)[2] / sum(table(data4$gender))*100)`%), which is likely a reflection of the broader publishing disparities between male and feamle scientists.

Preprints can be a useful way to ensure that research remains open and accessible to the research community as the paper is available online no matter what the published status of the preprint ends up being. Most of the published preprints ended up being open access(@fig-pubsummary A), however, the status of many (i.e., `r sum_is_oa$n[3]` or `r sum_is_oa$percent[3]*100`%) were unknown, and `r sum_is_oa$n[1]` or `r sum_is_oa$percent[1]*100`% were not published in open access reserach journals. The open access status of the papers that were published in open access journals also varied widely (@fig-pubsummary B). Data and code sharing is a key component of open science. Despite this, we found that `r preprint_data[1,2]` (`r preprint_data[1,"percent"]*100`%) of relevant preprints on *EcoEvoRxiv* (i.e., only where data was generated) did not share data, while `r preprint_code[1,2]` (`r preprint_code[1,"percent"]*100`%) did not share code. 

Authors may be reluctant to share data in code for preprints because of the perceived concern that others may acquire and use such data and code without authors' consent. However, while we found that `r pre_article_data[3,2]` (`r pre_article_data[3,"percent"]*100`%) of preprints that did not share data at the preprint stage did in the published article, there were still `r pre_article_data[2,2]` (`r pre_article_data[2,"percent"]*100`%) that never ended up sharing data. The same was true for code. Overall, while `r pre_article_code[3,2]` (`r pre_article_code[3,"percent"]*100`%) of preprints that did not share code at the preprint stage did in the published article, there were still `r pre_article_code[2,2]` (`r pre_article_code[2,"percent"]*100`%) that never ended up sharing code.

# Paving *our* own future of open, transparent and community driven science

Our data driven approach has allowed us to better understand some of the key elements of uncertainty surrounding preprints which provides us with opportunties to clarify our perspective and recommendations. First, authors need not be afraid of sharing data and code early in the publication process. Sharing data and code early can help improve the quality of research, establish precedence, and improve the transparency and computational reproducibility of scientific findings. If authors are worried about data being used unintentially, clear information surrounding its re-use and withholding some data or meta-data needed to understand the dataset may be options. Second, authors need to be aware of the benefits of posting preprints and postprints. Posting preprints can help establish precedence of research findings, ensure that research is open access, and help authors receive feedback on their research before it is published. It is notable that discussions around a preprints findings are still rare and its clear that we as a community need to provide better platforms that document discussions around a preprints findings. Third, authors need to be aware of the benefits of using community driven preprint servers. Community driven preprint servers are capable of setting their own agenda and are driven by the needs and disires of the community they would like their findings to be shared with. Supporting these initiatives should be a priority for all researchers. Lastly, it remains clear that the time between preprinting and publication is still quite long. One possible explanation is that preprints are not being sent to journals deemed suitable for the work. Interestingly, out of the `r nrow(data2)` preprints, only `r pci[2,2]` (`r pci[2,3]*100`%) used Peer Community In as a preprint peer-review service. Using PCI provides authors with quicker reviews of a paper and a more realistic recommendation of where such work is likely to be published. Many journals now also accept PCI reviews and recomendations when deciding to publish a paper. As such, we would encourage more authors to consider sending their preprints for PCI review to possibly speed up the publication process. 

Some authors have been frustrated by preprints and publications being disconnected in the digital world, with many instances where preprints and publications are not correctly recognised as the same paper that has developed over the peer review process. It was reasonably common for titles of preprints to change between the preprint and the published article (`r titles[2,2]` or `r titles[2,3]*100`%) and this was the major contributer to preprints and published articles not being matched. As such, we would recommend that authors make sure that, when preprints end up getting published, that they update preprints with the publication DOI when it's available. Particularly if their title has changed. This is quite easy for authors to do in *EcoEvoRxiv* and it will ensure that the preprint is linked to the published article and the citations are merged and the published paper is ultimately open access, allowing authors to save open access fees. 

Despite the early successes of the new initiatives taken by *EcoEvoRxiv* it is still clear that much work needs to be done to improve our communities understanding of preprints (and postprints). We view this perspective piece as one small step in achieving that goal.
