I've therefore based by data entry on this PDF (and my answer for Comments_on_preprint is therefore a guess). Related to this, also note that the preprint says all data are available as Supplementary Material, but I cannot find this especially with no landing page. I assume therefore that no data was deposited for the preprint stage and it was uploaded for the published version.
